Absolutely — here’s a clean, self‑contained **Markdown project brief** you can hand directly to Claude Code. It captures the architecture, metaphors, UI, and intent of Bartleby without assuming any prior conversation.

You can copy/paste this whole thing as‑is.

# **Bartleby: The Registrar’s Desk**  
*A narrative‑driven autonomous transformation orchestrator*

## **Overview**
Bartleby is a desktop companion built in C# (.NET MAUI + background worker) whose purpose is to quietly process a project’s backlog of tasks (initially GitHub issues) through a series of AI‑powered transformations. He is not a chatbot — he is a **scrivener‑agent** who works in the background, tending a single project at a time from his metaphorical workspace: **the Registrar’s Desk**.

Bartleby’s identity is shaped by three guiding principles:

- **Provenance** — every task has a lineage and history  
- **Parsimony** — everything in its proper place, nothing extraneous  
- **Canon** — Bartleby maintains the authoritative version of each transformation  

The UI and system architecture reflect these values.

# **Core Concepts**

## **1. Tasks**
The atomic unit of work.  
Tasks originate from GitHub (or future sources) and contain:

- description  
- context  
- constraints  
- project association  
- transformation history  
- current state  

## **2. Transformations**
Bartleby performs structured transformations on tasks:

- interpret  
- plan  
- execute  
- refine  
- ask clarifying questions  
- finalize  

Each transformation is logged with provenance.

## **3. Constraints**
Bartleby works within:

- token budgets  
- schedules  
- project priorities  
- daily/monthly caps  
- developer responses  

## **4. States (The Funnel)**
Tasks move through a canonical workflow:

- **To Do**  
- **In Progress**  
- **Blocked / Needs Input**  
- **Completed**  

This is the “funnel” or “ledger flow.”

---

# **Narrative Metaphor: The Registrar’s Desk**

Bartleby’s world is modeled after a historical **ledger desk** — the kind used by registrars, archivists, and clerks responsible for maintaining canonical records.

Key metaphors:

- **The Ledger Desk** — the active workspace  
- **The Ledger Drawer** — a slide‑out project switcher containing all known projects  
- **The Open Ledger** — the currently active project  
- **The Registrar’s Journal** — the log of Bartleby’s actions  
- **The Ink Bottle** — token budgets  
- **The Funnel Folios** — task states  

When Bartleby starts up, he automatically opens the **last ledger left on the desk**, resuming the previous project.

---

# **UI Structure**

The app uses a VS Code–style vertical sidebar with the following tabs:

### **📁 Ledger Drawer (Project Switcher)**
- A slide‑out panel listing all configured projects  
- Each project represented as a “ledger” with metadata  
- Selecting a project loads it as the active ledger  
- Only one project is active at a time  

### **🏠 Dashboard (The Desk Surface)**
Shows the heartbeat of the active project:

- Bartleby’s current activity  
- next scheduled run  
- token usage summary  
- project focus  
- recent actions  

### **📋 Work Funnel (The Open Ledger)**
A Kanban‑style view of the task states:

- To Do  
- In Progress  
- Blocked  
- Completed  

### **⏱️ Schedules (The Clock)**
Controls when Bartleby works:

- run interval  
- burst mode  
- quiet hours  
- next run time  

### **🪙 Token Budgets (The Ink Bottle)**
Controls resource usage:

- global monthly cap  
- per‑project caps  
- per‑task ceilings  
- model selection  

### **📜 Logs (The Registrar’s Journal)**
A chronological record of:

- transformations  
- questions asked  
- errors  
- GitHub updates  
- narrative commentary  

### **⚙️ Settings (The Drawer of Tools)**
Contains:

- API keys (GitHub, Azure OpenAI)  
- project configuration  
- behavior tuning  
- storage settings

# **Technical Architecture**

## **Platform**
- .NET MAUI desktop app  
- Background worker loop  
- Local storage for project state  
- Azure OpenAI for model inference  

## **Worker Loop**
Runs on a schedule:

1. Load active project  
2. Pull tasks from GitHub  
3. Move tasks through transformations  
4. Ask clarifying questions when needed  
5. Update GitHub or local state  
6. Log all actions  

## **Model Provider**
- Azure OpenAI (GPT‑5.x family)  
- Chosen for:
  - C# integration  
  - cost efficiency  
  - strong reasoning  
  - predictable token usage  

---

# **Design Philosophy**

Bartleby is:

- **a registrar**, not a chatbot  
- **a scrivener**, not a general AI  
- **a transformation orchestrator**, not a task runner  
- **a companion**, not a daemon  

His world is built around:

- clarity  
- order  
- narrative continuity  
- quiet competence  

The UI is not a dashboard — it is a **workspace**.

---

# **Future Extensions**

- Additional task sources (Notion, Jira, local files)  
- Multi‑model support  
- Project archiving  
- Custom transformation pipelines  
- Developer responses integrated into the funnel  

---

If you want, I can also generate:

- a version formatted as a README  
- a version structured as a technical spec  
- a version optimized for Claude’s “project context” window  
- or a version with diagrams (ASCII or Mermaid)

Just tell me which form you want next.
